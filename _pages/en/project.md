# Projects
My team and I are firm believers in the power of open science and sharing. We are committed to contributing our research back to the community through open-source projects to foster collaboration and accelerate technological advancement.

Personal Projects: My personal GitHub (chenxie95) hosts several repositories related to my teaching and research, such as deeplearning_course_sjtu.   

Lab Projects: The students I supervise are core contributors to the X-LANCE Lab's open-source ecosystem. We strive to translate our latest paper findings into high-quality, open-source code to promote reproducibility and rapid innovation.   

Here are some of our team's impactful open-source projects:
> SLAM-LLM	Speech, Language, Audio, Music Processing with Large Language Models.   
> code: [https://github.com/X-LANCE/SLAM-LLM](https://github.com/X-LANCE/SLAM-LLM)

> AniTalker	Animate vivid and diverse talking faces through identity-decoupled facial motion encoding.
