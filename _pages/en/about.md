# Biography

I am currently a Tenure-Track Associate Professor at the School of Computer Science, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, China. My research focuses on deep learning for speech signal processing, including audio understanding, audio generation, and speech-to-speech dialogue models. 

Over the past decade, I have been fortunate to live, study, and work in several wonderful cities — from Loudi@Hunan → Xiamen → Beijing → Cambridge → Seattle → Shanghai — and to meet many great mentors and collaborators along the way.

I am also a member of the [X-LANCE Lab](https://x-lance.github.io/zh/) at SJTU, where we explore cutting-edge research in speech AI, natural language processing, and multimodal information processing.

My current research interests include:

- Audio foundation models  
- Audio (including speech, sound, and music) understanding and generation   
- Speech recognition, synthesis, and translation  
- Self-supervised learning for audio signal  
- Audio-driven talking-face (Avatar)

# Openings

We are committed to building an open, relaxed, and collaborative research environment, where every student can grow and find a path that suits them.

We are always looking for excellent students — including undergraduates, master's students, and Ph.D. candidates — who are curious, courageous, and passionate about research, to explore the future of AI and work together on meaningful and impactful research.

You are welcome if you:

- Have a solid foundation in mathematics  
- Have basic knowledge of machine learning, especially deep learning  
- Enjoy programming and independent thinking  
- Are passionate about speech AI  

If you are interested in my research and would like to pursue a research internship (remote is also possible) or collaboration, feel free to contact me via email.

For master's or Ph.D. applicants, please indicate your interest in the email and attach your CV. I will get back to you as soon as possible if I still have openings.
