# About Me
Hello, I'm Xie Chen. I am currently a Tenure-Track Associate Professor and Ph.D. supervisor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU). My academic journey began with a bachelor's degree from Xiamen University, followed by a master's from Tsinghua University, and culminated in a Ph.D. from the Department of Engineering at the University of Cambridge. Before joining SJTU in the fall of 2021, I was a postdoctoral Research Associate at Cambridge and later served as a Senior and Principal Researcher at Microsoft's speech and language research group in Seattle.   

My transition from a world-leading industrial research lab back to academia was driven by a desire to pursue pioneering, independent research and to dedicate myself to mentoring the next generation of AI scientists. I am a core member of the SJTU X-LANCE Lab, where our team explores the frontiers of intelligent speech, natural language processing, and multi-modality information processing. My primary research interests include:   

- Deep learning and its applications in intelligent speech signal processing    
- End-to-end speech recognition, synthesis, and translation    
- Speech-oriented self-supervised learning    
- Audio-driven talking head technology    

# Teaching
I am actively involved in teaching both undergraduate and graduate courses, aiming to provide students with a solid foundation in computer science theory and practice. The core courses I have taught or co-taught include:

- Deep Learning
- Programming Paradigms (C++)
- You can find related course materials and code on my personal GitHub.   

# Research Projects
My research is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC). I am currently the Principal Investigator (PI) for the following project:

> Project Title: Towards Decoupling Acoustic and Linguistic Information in End-to-End Speech Recognition Systems  
> Program: NSFC Young Scientists Program  
> Grant No.: 62206171  
> Period: 2023 - 2026     


# Recruitment
I am always looking for self-motivated, curious, and enthusiastic students to join my team. Whether you are an undergraduate intern, a Master's applicant, or a Ph.D. candidate, I welcome you to reach out.   

I hope you have:

- A foundational knowledge of machine learning, especially deep learning.
- A passion for coding and independent thinking.

If my research direction interests you and you are eager to grow in an open, collaborative environment, please feel free to contact me via email (chenxie95@sjtu.edu.cn) to explore the endless possibilities of AI together.
