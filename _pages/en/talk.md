# Talks
I enjoy sharing our team's latest research progress and exchanging ideas with peers at academic conferences and universities.

- Invited Talk: In May 2023, I was invited by Hunan University of Humanities, Science and Technology to give a talk titled "Multilingual Simultaneous Interpretation and Audio-Driven Talking Head," where I shared the latest advancements from the X-LANCE Lab in conversational AI. Â  

- Academic Service: I served as a Session Chair for the "Adaptation and Personalization for Speech Models" session at the top-tier conference IEEE ICASSP 2022.
